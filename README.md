### Phase 1:  Build Queue System
#### Step 1:
#### Develop a queue system that can exercise your requirements with stub functions (In this case, have the stub functions return after set of seconds to simulate processing or server return time)
#### Step 2:
#### Test it with different parameters
#### Include tracking interface to show how many processes are going on and success of each
### Phase 2:  Speech to Text
